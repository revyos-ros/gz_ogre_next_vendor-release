# Gazebo Specific Vendor Package for Ogre-Next

This is a ROS 2 vendor package for
[Ogre-Next](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre-next) intended to be consumed by
Gazebo, specifically in
[`gz_rendering_vendor`](https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_rendering_vendor).
Use of this vendor package generally (outside of Gazebo) is not recommended as
the underlying Ogre-Next version might change without notice.
